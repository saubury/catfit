# Introduction

_Snowyâ€™s eating â€” tweeting my cats weight & dining habits with a Raspberry Pi_

Our cat Snowy ðŸ˜¸ has been enjoying her meals over winter. I wanted to start collecting data on her eating habits, and analyse her weight over time. This data is collected with food and cat weight measurements; alongside phots taken by two cameras. Data is collected and images processed locally using a Raspberry Pi.
